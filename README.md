# SauronVSInfiniteHobbits

How many hobbits would die in taking down Sauron using the roles for Lord of the Rings: Strategy Battle Game?

8 hobbits can surround Sauron. With infinite hobbits, new ones will fill in any gaps left by casualities.

Each turn, Sauron rolls 4d6 taking the highest, and the hobbits roll 8d6 taking the highest. The high roller gets to attack, with ties going to Sauron. The loser does not attack that turn.

If Sauron attacks, he rolls 8d6; for each 3+, a hobbit is killed.

If the hobbits attack, they roll 16d6; for each 6, roll a further d6; if this second roll is a 6+, it is a wound on Sauron.

Sauron has 5 wounds. However, if he would lose his last wound, he gets a special 2+ save from the One Ring. He has 3 points of Might which he can use to add +1 to these rolls; so once he is on his last wound, he will need to fail 4 One Ring saves to actually lose it.

We will track on which turn Sauron loses his last wound, as well as how many hobbits he kills before he dies.
